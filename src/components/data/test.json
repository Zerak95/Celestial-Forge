Since these are necessary to even start your game, they're even free... beyond the cost in Grist to construct them of course. But if you want to spend some of your CP here, you can start with a fully upgraded variant, gaining every upgrade made to this equipment during the story of Homestuck immediately, without the cost of grist going up at all or having to spend time fiddling around to get them.",
